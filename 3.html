        <h2>C++</h2>
        <p>
            C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that was developed in the 1980s as an<br>
            extension of the C programming language. It is a compiled language that is often used for<br>
            developing operating systems, device drivers, and other system software, as well as for developing<br>
            desktop applications, video games, and web applications. C++ is known for its performance,<br>
            flexibility, and power, but it can also be more complex and difficult to learn than other<br>
            programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            C++ is used by many large companies, including Microsoft, Google, and Adobe, and it is still widely<br>
            used in industry today. It is also a popular language for teaching computer science and<br>
            programming, due to its ability to teach low-level programming concepts and its usefulness in a<br>
            wide variety of applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the key features of C++ is its support for object-oriented programming (OOP), which allows<br>
            developers to organize code into reusable, modular components known as classes. C++ also<br>
            supports generic programming, which allows developers to write code that can be used with any<br> 
            data type.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that is used in many different<br>
            applications and industries. While it may be more challenging to learn than some other languages,<br> 
            it is a valuable skill for any programmer to have.
