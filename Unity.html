                <h2>Unity</h2>
                <p>
                    Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies. It is used to develop video<br>
                    games for PC, consoles, mobile devices, and websites. Unity supports a variety of programming<br>
                    languages, including C#, C++, and JavaScript, and it includes a visual editor for designing game<br>
                    worlds and user interfaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unity is known for its ease of use and versatility, making it a popular choice for both indie and AAA<br>
                    game developers. It is also used for developing non-game applications, such as architectural<br>
                    visualizations and training simulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the key features of Unity is its component-based architecture, which allows developers to<br>
                    create complex game objects by combining simple components. Unity also includes a physics<br>
                    engine, animation tools, and support for virtual reality and augmented reality development.
