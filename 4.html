        <h2>Unity</h2>
        <p>
            Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies. It is used to develop video<br>
            games for PC, consoles, mobile devices, and websites. Unity supports a variety of programming<br>
            languages, including C#, C++, and JavaScript, and it includes a visual editor for designing game<br>
            worlds and user interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unity is known for its ease of use and versatility, making it a popular choice for both indie and AAA<br>
            game developers. It is also used for developing non-game applications, such as architectural<br>
            visualizations and training simulations.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the key features of Unity is its component-based architecture, which allows developers to<br>
            create complex game objects by combining simple components. Unity also includes a physics<br>
            engine, animation tools, and support for virtual reality and augmented reality development.
