        <h3>What is .NET?</h3>
        <p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/" target="_blank" title=".NET document">.NET</a> is a software framework developed by Microsoft that primarily runs on Microsoft Windows. It<br>
        provides a runtime environment that manages the execution of code and provides services such as<br>
        memory management, security, and exception handling. The .NET framework is used to develop a<br>
        wide range of applications, including desktop applications, web applications, and mobile<br>
        applications.</p>
        <img src = "coding.jpg" width="450">
        <p>One of the key benefits of .NET is its ability to support multiple programming languages, including<br>
        C#, Visual Basic .NET, and F#. This allows developers to choose the language that best suits their<br>
        needs and preferences.</p>
