        <p>
            Programming is the process of creating software, applications, and other computer programs using a programming language.<br>
            A programming language is a set of instructions used to communicate with a computer and tell it what to do. Programmers<br>
            use these languages to write code that can be executed by a computer to perform a specific task or set of tasks.<br>
            Programming is a critical skill in today's digital age, and it is used in many different industries and applications,<br> 
            from developing video games and mobile apps to creating financial software and scientific simulations.
