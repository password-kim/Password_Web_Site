        <h2>C#</h2>
        <p>
            C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft in 2000. It was<br>
            designed to be simple, type-safe, and efficient. C# is widely used for developing applications that<br> 
            run on the .NET Framework. It is similar to Java in its syntax and structure but also includes features<br> 
            from other programming languages such as C++.
        </p>
        <p>
            C# is used for developing a variety of applications, including desktop applications, web<br>
            applications, mobile apps, and video games. It is particularly popular for developing Windows<br>
            applications and is the primary language used for developing Windows desktop applications. C# is<br> 
            also used for developing Windows Store apps and Windows Phone apps.
        </p>
        <p>
            C# is a powerful language that is constantly evolving. It is supported by a large community of<br>
            developers, and there are many resources available for learning and using the language. Whether<br> 
            you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, C# is a great language to learn and use for<br>
            developing applications.<br>
